What is Composition Design Pattern?
Composition is a technique where an object is composed of other objects, 
meaning it has references to other objects to achieve its functionality.

How it Works?
Instead of inheriting everything from a superclass, 
composition allows an object to include ("compose") other objects 
that provide specific behaviors.

Example:
Imagine youâ€™re building a "Robot" that needs multiple behaviors like "speak" and "move."
Rather than making "Robot" a subclass of every type of "Speaker" or "Mover," 
you can instead create a Speaker and Mover component that "Robot" can use. 
This makes "Robot" flexible because you can change or add new behaviors easily.
